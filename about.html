        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p> Hello! I'm Nidha Latheef, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from MEA Engineering College, Perinthalmanna. <br>
            My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in various programming languages and technologies, including Python, Java, HTML/CSS,<br>
            and machine learning.I've consistently demonstrated my ability to complete tasks on time, whether working independently or as part of a team.
            <br>
            Throughout my studies, I've been actively involved in volunteering with organizations like IEEE MEA Student Branch and the National Service Scheme.<br>
            These experiences have helped me develop strong leadership, teamwork, and program coordination skills. I have also undertaken projects such as a <br>
            Disease Prediction System and a Loan Prediction System, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques to provide practical solutions in healthcare<br>
            and financial services.

            and Malayalam, with a beginner proficiency in Tamil, I am enthusiastic about gaining real-world experience in the workforce. My goal is to apply my <br>
